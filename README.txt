2-approximation algorithm implementation of n-PSP & ANSC README
===============================================================

This is the README file for "2-approximation algorithm for n-PSP and ANSC" file in our code files.

Open Command Prompt, and navigate to the implementation code file folder.
Give command "jupyter notebook". Then it opens in localhost.
Open the .ipynb code file "2-approximation algorithm for n-PSP and ANSC" from list of file.
Click on the cell related to "2-approximation algorithm for n-PSP" code and click on "Run" button at the top tool bar.
Click on the cell related to "2-approximation algorithm for ANSC" code and click on "Run" button at the top tool bar.

In our implemenation code itself, we have provided the example graph of input and so it takes the input automatically and displays the output of it below that particular cell.
